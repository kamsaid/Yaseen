    title: "Virtue of Making Tasbeeh",
    arabic: "كَلِمَتَانِ خَفِيفَتَانِ عَلَى اللِّسَانِ، ثَقِيلَتَانِ فِي الْمِيزَانِ، حَبِيبَتَانِ إِلَى الرَّحْمَنِ: (سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ)، (سُبْحانَ اللهِ الْعَظِيمِ)",
    translation: "There are two words which are light on the tongue, heavy on the scale, and loved by the Most Merciful: SubhanAllahi wa bihamdi, SubhanAllahi al-azeem (Glorified is Allah and praised is He, Glorified is Allah the Most Great).",
    source: "Bukhari and Muslim",
    explanation: "The remembrance of Allah is what gives comfort to the heart and soul. In this hadith, the Prophet (ﷺ) informs us of the great blessings that result from two particularly short phrases verbalized on a Muslim's tongue. The word tasbeeh means to negate from Allah every type of defect and imperfection. The most typical phrase used to do this in Arabic is to say SubhanAllah. The two phrases mentioned are easy to say in any situation without difficulty. A person can repeat them over and over again often and this is why the Prophet (ﷺ) recommended it.\n\nWe are also informed that the weight of these two short phrases will be very heavy on the Day of Judgment when all of our good and bad deeds will be weighed against each other on the scale. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) stated that these two phrases, in particular, are very beloved by Allah. This indicates that doing tasbeeh of Allah and praising Him is among the best forms of supererogatory worship.\n\nThis hadith also teaches us about the vastness of Allah's mercy over us because He is willing to give us lots of reward for doing small good deeds.",

    title: "Good Treatment of Parents",
    arabic: "جَاءَ رَجُلٌ إِلَى رَسُولِ اللهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَقَالَ يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ مَنْ أَحَقُّ بِحُسْنِ صَحَابَتِي قَالَ ‏\"‏ أُمُّكَ ‏\"‏‏.‏ قَالَ ثُمَّ مَنْ قَالَ ‏\"‏ أُمُّكَ ‏\"‏‏.‏ قَالَ ثُمَّ مَنْ قَالَ ‏\"‏ أُمُّكَ ‏\"‏‏.‏ قَالَ ثُمَّ مَنْ قَالَ ‏\"‏ ثُمَّ أَبُوكَ‏\".‏‏‏",
    translation: "A man came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Who among the people has the most right to my good company?\" He replied, \"Your mother.\" The man said, \"Then who?\" He replied, \"Your mother.\" The man said, \"Then who?\" He replied, \"Your mother.\" The man said, \"Then who?\" He replied, \"Then your father.\"",
    source: "Bukhari and Muslim",
    explanation: "The mother symbolizes sacrifice, honor, and purity. She is usually the first to look after the child. In this hadith, the Prophet (ﷺ) is asked about the person most deserving of good companionship among the people and he responds that it is the mother. The Prophet (ﷺ) emphasizes this fact three times, which goes to show the high level of regard for the mother over other relatives in the religion.\n\nThe father being mentioned only once does not mean that there is deficiency in his right to good treatment, rather, the point is to show the greatness of the mother's right. Some speculate that the reasons may be due to the abundance of her favors over the child and the many physical and psychological hardships endured by her during pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding. She also serves and has more compassion for her children than others.",

    title: "Avoiding Suspicion",
    arabic: "إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظَّنَّ, فَإِنَّ اَلظَّنَّ أَكْذَبُ اَلْحَدِيثِ",
    translation: "Beware of suspicion for it is the most untruthful type of speech.",
    source: "Bukhari and Muslim",
    explanation: "Islamic law encourages reconciliation, consolidation, and harmony between Muslims and it prohibits anything that may cause rift, hostility, hatred, and disunity between them. In this hadith, the Prophet (ﷺ) warns us against one of the things that leads to hostility and disunity in the community: suspicion. This is when someone accuses another of doing something wrong in his/her heart without evidence. In other words, it is to think evil of other Muslims.\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) warned us against it because it leads to hostility, hatred, rumors, and overall disunity within the community. Everyone ends up suffering due to something that is not even confirmed. How often have we heard of cases where marriages are broken, friendships lost, and communities torn apart all because someone thought somebody was doing something wrong only to realize later that they were heavily mistaken in their assessment.",

    title: "Guarding the Tongue",
    arabic: "إِنَّ الْعَبْدَ لَيَتَكَلَّمُ بِالْكَلِمَةِ مَا يَتَبَيَّنُ فِيهَا، يَزِلُّ بِهَا فِي النَّارِ أَبْعَدَ مِمَّا بَيْنَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَ الْمَغْرِبِ",
    translation: "A slave [of Allah] may utter a word without giving it much thought by which he slips into the fire a distance further than that between east and west.",
    source: "Bukhari and Muslim",
    explanation: "The tongue is a great blessing of Allah and despite its small size, it could be the cause of a person's bliss or doom in the afterlife. Therefore, it is very important for a Muslim to safeguard his/her tongue from lying, backbiting, slandering, cursing, and a host of other sins that emanate from this single organ. In fact, some words are so dangerous that they can throw a person outside the fold of Islam.\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) in this hadith is teaching us about the effects of words and their consequences. A person could utter a word or statement thinking nothing of it, and may even consider it insignificant, however, in the sight of Allah it may be highly detested, which causes the person to fall into the depths of hellfire. The opposite could also occur. A person may utter a word or statement and not give it much attention, however, in the sight of Allah it may be highly loved, which causes the person to be raised several levels in paradise.",

    title: "Avoiding the Forbidden",
    arabic: "إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى وَغَيْرَةُ اللهِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ الْمُؤْمِنُ مَا حَرَّمَ اللهُ",
    translation: "Allah becomes jealous [of His honor] and that is when the believer does something He has forbidden.",
    source: "Bukhari and Muslim",
    explanation: "Allah placed limitations and laws within which we must live our lives and then He sent His prophets and messengers to convey those restrictions to the people. In this way, the evidence is established against the sinners because the messengers and prophets fulfilled their duty of informing us of the permissible and prohibited.\n\nIn this hadith, the Prophet (ﷺ) warns the believers from occupying themselves in forbidden matters. The Prophet (ﷺ) worded it in a way so that a true believer would not even think about doing something forbidden. The believers are specifically pointed out because they should know better. The disbelievers might be engaging in forbidden things out of ignorance but a believer has no excuse, therefore, there is a stern warning in this hadith to the believers from committing prohibited deeds.",

    title: "Virtue of Ramadan",
    arabic: "مَنْ قَامَ رَمَضَانَ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا، غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ",
    translation: "Whoever stands [for night prayer] in Ramadan out of faith and hope for reward will be forgiven his past sins.",
    source: "Bukhari and Muslim",
    explanation: "Ramadan is a blessed month in which Allah has made fasting obligatory upon the believers. It is a month of mercy, forgiveness, and salvation from the hellfire. In this hadith, the Prophet (ﷺ) informs us of one of the many virtues of this blessed month. The phrase \"stands in Ramadan\" refers to the night prayer known as Taraweeh, which is performed after the obligatory Isha prayer. It is a highly recommended act during the month of Ramadan.\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) mentions two conditions for the forgiveness of past sins: faith and hope for reward. This means that the person must believe in Allah and His promise of reward for this act of worship, and must perform it solely for the sake of Allah hoping to attain His pleasure and reward. If these two conditions are met, then Allah will forgive the person's past minor sins.",

    title: "Virtue of Umrah and Hajj",
    arabic: "الْعُمْرَةُ إِلَى الْعُمْرَةِ كَفَّارَةٌ لِمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَالْحَجُّ الْمَبْرُورُ لَيْسَ لَهُ جَزَاءٌ إِلَّا الْجَنَّةُ",
    translation: "One Umrah to the next is an expiation for whatever happened between them and the only reward for an accepted Hajj is paradise.",
    source: "Bukhari and Muslim",
    explanation: "In this hadith, there is encouragement for us to perform Umrah multiple times in our lives. Allah made good deeds as a way to expiate us from our sins and to raise our ranks. One of the best ways to do this is through Umrah and Hajj. The former can be performed any time of the year and can be completed in one day but the latter can only be done during the season of Hajj and takes multiple days to complete.\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) is teaching us the blessing of doing Umrah and Hajj. For Umrah, we are taught that whoever performs it multiple times, then it will be an expiation of sins committed between them. This means the person will not be held responsible for them on the Day of Judgment. It should be noted that this is in reference to minor sins and not major ones. The latter require sincere repentance and good deeds alone will not suffice to wipe them out.",

    title: "Yawning",
    arabic: "التَّثَاؤُبُ مِنْ الشَّيْطَانِ فَإِذَا تَثَاءَبَ أَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيَكْظِمْ مَا اسْتَطَاعَ",
    translation: "Yawning is from the devil so whenever one of you yawns, then let him try to suppress it as much as possible.",
    source: "Bukhari and Muslim",
    explanation: "Yawning is a natural bodily function that occurs when a person is tired, bored, or sleepy. In this hadith, the Prophet (ﷺ) teaches us the etiquette of yawning. He informs us that yawning is from the devil, which means that the devil loves it when a person yawns because it indicates laziness, tiredness, or boredom, which are states that the devil exploits to lead a person astray.\n\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) advises us to try to suppress yawning as much as possible. This can be done by closing the mouth, covering it with the hand, or trying to hold it back. If a person is unable to suppress it, then he should at least cover his mouth with his hand to prevent the devil from entering it, as mentioned in another hadith.",

    title: "Kindness",
    arabic: "إِنَّ اللهَ رَفِيقٌ يُحِبُّ الرِّفْقَ فِي الأَمْرِ كُلِّهِ",
    translation: "Allah is Kind and He loves kindness in all matters.",
    source: "Bukhari and Muslim",
    explanation: "Kindness is a virtue that is highly emphasized in Islam. In this hadith, the Prophet (ﷺ) informs us that Allah is Kind and He loves kindness in all matters. This means that Allah deals with His creation with kindness and mercy, and He loves it when His servants deal with each other in the same manner.\n\nThe word \"rifq\" in Arabic, which is translated as kindness, encompasses gentleness, leniency, and compassion. It is the opposite of harshness, severity, and roughness. The Prophet (ﷺ) is teaching us that kindness should be our default approach in all matters, whether it is in our dealings with others, in our speech, in our actions, or even in our thoughts.",

    title: "Seeking Knowledge",
    arabic: "مَنْ سَلَكَ طَرِيقًا يَلْتَمِسُ فِيهِ عِلْمًا سَهَّلَ اللهُ لَهُ بِهِ طَرِيقًا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ",
    translation: "Whoever takes a path in search of knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise.",
    source: "Muslim",
    explanation: "Islam places a high value on knowledge and learning. In this hadith, the Prophet (ﷺ) encourages us to seek knowledge by informing us of the great reward that awaits those who do so. The \"path\" mentioned in the hadith can be literal, such as traveling to a place of learning, or figurative, such as dedicating time and effort to study and research.\n\nThe knowledge referred to in this hadith is primarily religious knowledge, which includes understanding the Quran, the Sunnah, Islamic jurisprudence, and other Islamic sciences. However, it also encompasses any beneficial knowledge that contributes to the welfare of humanity and does not contradict Islamic principles.\n\nThe reward for seeking knowledge is that Allah will make easy for the seeker a path to Paradise. This could mean that Allah will guide the person to do good deeds that lead to Paradise, or that Allah will make the journey to Paradise easy for the person in the Hereafter. Either way, it is a great incentive for Muslims to continuously seek knowledge throughout their lives.",
